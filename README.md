# Email Application

A [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) application to deliver emails via SMTP using the [JavaMail](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javamail.html) Library. Here I plan to develop Restful web service that can be used to send emails with or without attachments.

I know that Spring MVC is a widely used module of spring which is used to create scalable web applications. But the main disadvantage of spring projects is that configuration is really time-consuming. To tackle this I'm here using Spring Boot which is built on the top of the spring and contains all the features of spring.

I will for now create the structure of an application using spring initializr and then use an IDE to create a sample GET route.

> Spring Initializr is simply a web-based tool using which one can easily generate the structure of the Spring Boot project. It also provides various different features for the projects expressed in a metadata model. This model allows to configure the list of dependencies which are supported by JVM.

With the base architecture of application setup, I will update the flow of project here as it proceeds.
